			   ARGUMENT PASSING

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

	Argument passing is needed when executing a new process, since we 
	need to save arguments in the stack in order for the new process to
	obtain the arguments.

	So, it all starts with process_execute() in src/userprog/process.c.
	In process_execute(), thread_create() is called so that the new thread
	can run this process. As arguments of thread_create(), executing file
	name needs to be passed on.
	
	So first step here, we parsed the file name from the cmd line message 
	and passed it on, so that the thread_create() function will get only 
	the file name. We also have to pass on fn_copy, which is the copy of 
	the entire cmd line message for the use in further functions
	(like load()).

	By calling thread_create(), start_process() is also called.
	Inside start_process(), we don’t need to perform any parsing, but 
	load() is called with the char pointer, fn_copy, which is the original
	 and complete cmd line message. 

	Inside load(), for filesys_open() function, we parsed the file name out 
	and we also modified the arguments for setup_stack() to accept the 
	original cmd line message additionally. 

	In setup_stack(), we created int numarg (for counting number of args == 
	argc) and char ** args_array (to save the parsed out arguments). 
	Then, we tokenised the input cmd line message and put them inside the 
	args_array, while counting number of args. 
	
	After this, we decreased the stack step by step and pushed the 
	appropriate values and info. 
	The argv[] elements should be inserted in the opposite order, so we 
	looped the args_array from back to front, calculate the size of each 
	tokens, decreased the stack by that size and pushed them there.



---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

	strtok() is unstable in multithreading environments. strtok() uses
	a static buffer stored in the data segment. Because data segments
	can contain global variables, variables in the data segments can be
	accessed from anywhere. In other words, the static buffer used by
	strtok() is not atomic.
	The strtok_r() function works the same as strtok(). However, instead
	of using a static buffer, we use a char* type variable that is 
	passed as a parameter.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

	As we explained above, each process has own list of file_fd_pair 
	which keep tracks each file and its fd.
	Because each process(thread) has its own fd_max variable, file 	
	descriptors are unique just within a single process. 
	
	

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

	syscall_handler() extracts syscall_read and syscall_write parameters 
	from the stack frame. Check all exceptional conditions before 
	passing them to each function as parameters. (Such as an invalid 
	pointer)

	When reading or writing to syscall_read or write to file, use lock 
	to synchronize. If fd is 0 or 1, syscall_read uses input_getc () 
	repeatedly, and syscall_write uses putbuf (), repectively. Otherwise,
	use file_read() and file_write(), respectively.

	Although each byte of memory is addressable, operating systems 
	manage the memory in pages(4KB), which means that one access to the 
	memory loads an entire page into main memory. So, if the entire user 
	space data (4096 bytes) was allocated as a contiguous memory, 
	accessing memory once through the page table and address translation 
	will copy the full page into the kernel. However, if each byte of 
	data is not contiguous, in the worst case, 4096 accesses are required. 
	In case of 2 bytes of data, it does not matter whether the size of 
	data is smaller, since accessing memory is always done in units of 
	pages. Therefore the least number is also one here. The worst case, 
	it is twice, since it is only 2 bytes. 

	If we want to improve this, there are many different aspects that 
	could be touched, but after all we always have to deal with 
	trade-offs. For instance, if we increase the page size, we may 
	decrease the worst case scenario, since we have a better chance that 
	with one access of memory, our desired data are in the same page. 
	However, increasing page size will lead to overall slower memory 
	accesses and wasting memory as not all of the data in a single page 
	is used all the time. Overall, we think there is not much to improve.



>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

	Retrieves a child_info with a tid that matches the tid of the child 
	that needs to wait, while walking around child_info_list.
	Then check is_exited and call sema_down() if the child is not 		
	already terminated. Since child calls sema_up() in process_exit () 
	when the child exits, the parent process can wait until the child 
	terminates. 
	
	It then free() the child and returns the exit_stat_code of the 
	child. If there is no child that matches tid at first, it just 
	returns -1.

	All pointers are checked whether they are less than 0xc0000000 (ie, 
	they are in range of user virtual memory). If it is outside this 
	range, call syscall_exit (-1).

	Even within this range, unmapped pointers can cause page faults. So 
	modify the code in exception.c and call syscall_exit (-1) to 
	terminate the process when this problem occurs.

	syscall_exit () internally calls thread_exit (). This function frees 
	all allocated resources (filelock, file pointers, file_fd_list, 
	executable, page directory).
	
	For example, in the bad-jump and bad-jump2 tests, they each use a 
	null pointer and a pointer to 0xc0000000. 0xc0000000 is not in the 
	range of user virtual memory, and since null pointer is also an 
	unmapped pointer, each error handling routine calls syscall_exit ().

	I could not use pointers proficiently, so it was hard to imagine how 
	to simply pass load status by only using parameters. Instead, we 
	created a variable named child_load_success in the thread structure.

	If load fails, success is false in load () function, or something 
	goes wrong at process_execute () (for example, thread_create (), 
	tid_allocate () is not possible). In this case, assign 
	child_load_success as 'false'. 
	
	Intuitively, when the load succeeds, it is when the 'success' of the 
	load () function is 'true'. In this case, child_load_success is 
	'true'. The 'exec' system call checks this boolean value to 
	determine whether to return -1.

	Our implementation ensures that when P calls wait(C) before C 
	exits, then P will wait for C to exit through P’s semaphore, so 
	that when C exits, it will call sema_up and unblock P. If C has 
	already exited when P calls wait(C), then the sema_down will 
	return without having to block P. 
	When C exits and P returns from sema_down, it means that C is a 
	terminated process. So, here, we free the corresponding child 
	struct. 
	
	In cases when P terminates without waiting for C (same thing 
	happens whether C exits before or after), the resources of all 
	children will be handled by P. In process_exit(), we free all 
	the all the child struct in the child list of the parent. Then, 
	the child processes will just be an orphan and be executed with 
	out a parent. 

	
	
---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

	We check the null pointer and out-of-range(>= 0xc0000000) pointers 
	first because they can be checked simply, and the unmapped pointer 
	causes a page fault, so we handle it in exception.c. The process of 
	validating an unmapped pointer is little bit slower, so we used a 
	page fault.



>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

	It is very simple because it simply assigns fd to each file while 
	just increasing fd_max.
	
	We have implemented the mapping between fd and file using structs 	
	and lists. Since fd is an integer, we expect it to be more efficient 
	for searching file by fd if we use a structure such as file pointer 
	list or hashmap(like Java).
	
	file pointer list F: F[fd value] = file pointer of some file

	However, the disadvantage is when many files are opened, we may run 
	out of the file descriptors. So, optimally, when we close the file, 
	we might need to be able to reuse that fd in the future. 



>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

	We didn't change it. It's reasonable enough.
